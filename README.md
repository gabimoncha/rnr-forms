## Getting Started

This is a template for creating a custom registry using Next.js or Expo.

- The template uses a `registry.json` file to define components and their files. These are found in both `apps/docs` and `apps/showcase` folders.
- The `shadcn build` command is used to build the registry.
- You can use `turbo registry` to build the registry. This will generate the `public/r` folders in both `apps/docs` and `apps/showcase`.
- The registry items are served as static files under `public/r/[name].json`.
- Every registry item are compatible with the `shadcn` CLI.
